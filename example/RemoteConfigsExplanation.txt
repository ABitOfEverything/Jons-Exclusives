	0: basic message (uses message as a string), and can enable fireworks as a boolean,
	1: message (mainly for coloring) + Thank you for x downloads! shows up until y downloads are reached. Will work only if Technic's API works,
	2: message (mainly for coloring) + player name + , Have fun playing!
	
	3+ or -1-: Unimplemented, would return an error in the log (won't crash)"
