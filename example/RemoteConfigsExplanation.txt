	"_comment": "Everything should be pretty straightforward, except args:
	0: basic message (uses message as a string), and can enable fireworks as a boolean,
	1: Special message (Thank you for x downloads!), can add colors as the normal message (has to use escaped color versions), for surpassing x (int) messages, to show up until y (int) is reached, for the specified slug
	can be used only for all Technic modpacks, as long as the Technic API works correctly
	
	2+ or -1-: Unimplemented (at the moment), would return an error in the log (won't crash)"
